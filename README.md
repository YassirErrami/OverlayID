# OverlayID
Create a video overlay system that generates a unique ID for each person watching a video, allowing you to detect (track or identify) who is watching the video. 
This means:
Every viewer gets assigned a unique identifier.


The overlay likely displays or uses this ID, and you can use it to log, track, or personalize viewer interactions.


The main goals are to detect, differentiate, or perhaps personalize the video experience for each individual viewer.
